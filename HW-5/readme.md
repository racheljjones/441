# HW-5 Readme for YOUR_NAME

Please place your response to this week here.
Im not really enjoying this class because of all the math. All these codes and details are math equations and can be hard to follow. My mind does nit handle numbers well as well as all the symbols and functions. I hope I make as I graduate this May.
